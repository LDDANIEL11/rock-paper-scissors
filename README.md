# rock-paper-scissors

a simple project for the odin project javascript sessions , this project is very simple and played in the console section .

update - aug 6 - 2025 :

this was supposed to be a simple game when i started it , like the odin project just wanted this game to be a simple game which tries to force us to understand the if statement and etc... but i added html and css and eventlistners to it since i had experience in such games already , like the Guess game or the dice game projects which i have them in my github profile repos as js-projects-1 and 2

i actually used my experience on modal button projects for overlay windws in this game as well
its not so very neat , yeah sure , but this is the first steps of my journey in programming , but i actually am proud of myself for doing this project all alone in every aspects and matters , i mean Html & Css & JavaScript and everything from scratch ...

GoodLuck in your journey of programming lads ...
